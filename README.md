WINTER Token Staking Smart Contract
This project implements a simple staking smart contract for WINTER tokens on the MultiversX blockchain. The contract allows users to stake their tokens, locking them for a specified number of epochs. The contract is written in Rust and compiles to WebAssembly (Wasm) for deployment on the blockchain.

Features
Stake WINTER Tokens: Users can stake their WINTER tokens, which are then locked for a minimum number of epochs.
View Staked Tokens: Users can query the contract to view their staked token details, including the amount and lock duration.

Setup
Prerequisites
Rust and Wasm Toolchain: Ensure you have Rust installed, including the wasm32-unknown-unknown target for compiling to WebAssembly.
MultiversX SDK: Install the MultiversX SDK for deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/winter-staking.git
cd winter-staking
Add Wasm Target:

rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
Build the Contract:

cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
Contract Overview
Code Explanation
lib.rs
Trait Definition: The WinterTokenStaking trait defines the contract's endpoints and view functions. It includes:

stake_token_winter: Endpoint for staking tokens.
get_staked_tokens: View function to query staked tokens.
Initialization: The init function sets up the contract state during deployment.

contract.rs
StakedTokens Structure: Represents the staking details for a user, including the amount and lock duration.

Staking Logic: The stake_token_winter function handles staking operations, ensuring valid token and amount, and updating the staked data.

View Function: The get_staked_tokens function retrieves staked token details for a specific address.

Trait Implementation: The WinterTokenStaking trait outlines the methods for interacting with the blockchain and managing storage.

Interacting with the Contract
Deploy the Contract: Use the MultiversX SDK to deploy the compiled .wasm file to the blockchain.

Stake Tokens: Call the stake_token_winter endpoint, providing the token identifier and amount.

Query Staked Tokens: Use the get_staked_tokens view function to check the staking status for a given address.

Future Enhancements
Rewards Mechanism: Implement a rewards distribution system for stakers.
Withdrawal Functionality: Allow users to withdraw their staked tokens after the lock period.
Security Improvements: Enhance security features to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
